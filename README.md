This is the Module 2 final exam for the Adalab Front End Web Development Bootcamp. This module is all about Javascript so that's where the bulk of the project is.

The assignment is to create a TV series search engine using the TVmaze open API. Minimum requirements include:

A text input box and submit button
Contact server and display results (a name and photo for each series, providing a placeholder photo if a series doesn't have its own)
Allow for a favorites list that can be created by clicking on each series we want to add to the list
Favoriting a series changes the background color of series in search results
Favorited series must be displayed in a favorites list section
Save favorites list in local storage
As extras, we are given some suggestions:

The option to delete series from the favorites list (must update local storage too)
A delete all favorites button
The ability to delete a favorite by clicking on the series in the search results (resetting the background color)
Favorited series show up already marked in search results (background color changes are applied each time new search results are shown)
